# PM0.1_Prediction_DL_Model
Ultrafine particulate matter (PM0.1) poses significant health risks. This study uses a deep-learning regression model to predict PM0.1 concentrations based on meteorological factors, achieving an R² of 92.52% and an RMSE of 0.26 µg/m³, supporting preventive health decision-making.
